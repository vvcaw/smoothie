A **smooth** *high-level* rendering library developed in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

**Smoothie** is supposed to provide a simple-to-use rendering API, aimed to enable users to easily animate data.

## A Quick Note
**Smoothie** is currently in early development stages and therefore not at all functional.
